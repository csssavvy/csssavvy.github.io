This is the official first blog post from CSSsavvy. On this blog I'm planning to write some, what I would consider, interesting pieces of food for thought. Most of the things on here are things that I struggle with from day to day and that I really want to share. Not only to find out how other people think about them, but also to improve my own skills. 

Among other things expect to find:
* Front-end best practices
* Food for thought
* HTML5 & CSS3 basics
* SCSS/SASS basics 
* Heavily opinionated preferences for IDE's

``` scss
.block {
  display: block;
  position: relative;
  
  &__element {
    display: inline-block;
  }
  
  &--modifier {
    color: fff;
  }
}
```
