Csssavvy is a project created in order to get in touch with other developer, as a project to spill my mind an thoughts on subjects or to rant in general about webdevelopment. When I was a kid I finished primary school without any problems, the same thing goes for my highschool and college. Not one year was skipped, not one decision was ever changed. 

So there I was at the age of 20, completely finished with the entire curriculum for my field. I could've done masters, which would've completed my list, but it was at this point I decided to take matters into my own hands. I wanted to go to work, and learn what that had to offer. 4 years in and I feel like I've learned more in this time then all my school time combined. I'm happy about where I am right now, but in order to take my skills one step further, I want to engage with the giant community that's out there and become a part of that.
